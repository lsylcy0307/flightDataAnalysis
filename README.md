In this data challenge, you will be evaluating the on-time performance of passenger airlines and potential causes for flight delays. In this dataset, each instance (row) corresponds to a flight, some of which departed on time and some of which were delayed. Each instance is also accompanied by a variety of its attributes, including the operating airline, departure/arrival airports, delay duration, and weather conditions.

Data Challenge Questions:

You may choose to tackle some or all of these questions. Use whatever tools, programming
languages, and models you are comfortable with and have at your disposal. Answering one or two
questions thoroughly and deeply is preferable to attempting all of the questions without
understanding your model or assumptions.

1. EDA: Does the data have any interesting quirks or features? Describe any important
preprocessing/wrangling steps you took to clean the data.

2. Classification: What are the most predictive factors in determining if a flight is delayed
for more than 15 minutes? Brainstorm or build a predictive classification model for the
‘DEP_DEL15’ column of the dataset. Explain your feature selection process. Feature
engineering may be useful for this prediction.

3. Regression: Similar to question 2, what are the most predictive factors in determining the duration
of a flight delay? Brainstorm or build a predictive regression model for the ‘DEP_DELAY_NEW’
column of the dataset. Explain how you evaluate the performance of the model, and please be
prepared to defend your assumptions around the model performance.

4. So What? What are your final business recommendations to the business management team at this
airline? What are the major insights and business implications? Incorporate the analysis from the
models used in previous questions to recommend steps or action items to better identify flight delays
beyond using the model itself.
